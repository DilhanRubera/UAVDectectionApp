# Bushfire Monitoring System Using ADTs

## Project Overview
This project is a bushfire monitoring system that leverages advanced data structures and algorithms to process UAV-collected data. The system identifies high-risk areas, optimizes UAV flight paths, and supports dynamic graph operations. Key functionalities include graph traversal, hashing, heap operations, and shortest-path calculations.

## Features
- **Graph Representation**: Represent the area of interest using an adjacency list graph.
- **Graph Traversal**: Implement BFS and DFS for pathfinding and exploration.
- **Dynamic Graph Operations**: Add, delete, and search for locations in the graph using an interactive menu.
- **Data Storage with Hashing**: Efficiently store and retrieve location-specific data using a hash table.
- **Risk Assessment with Heaps**: Use a heap data structure to track and prioritize high-risk areas.
- **UAV Itinerary Optimization**: Generate efficient flight paths for UAVs based on high-risk locations.
- **Interactive Menu**: A user-friendly menu for all operations, including error handling and exception management.
